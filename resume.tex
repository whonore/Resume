\cventry{2022--}
        {Byzantine Atomic Distributed Objects}
        {Yale University}
        {Advised by: Zhong Shao}
        {}
        {%
          Extending the Atomic Distributed Object model to support byzantine
          fault tolerant protocols.

\cventry{2021--2022}
        {Reconfigurable Atomic Distributed Objects}
        {Yale University}
        {Advised by: Zhong Shao}
        {}
        {%
          Extended the Atomic Distributed Object model with additional metadata
          to enable simple verification of protocol-level safety properties.
          Completed the first mechanized safety proof for a reconfigurable
          consensus protocol by showing that a Coq specification of a Raft-like
          protocol refines the model.
        }
\cventry{2018--2021}
        {Atomic Distributed Objects}
        {Yale University}
        {Advised by: Zhong Shao}
        {}
        {%
          Developed a general framework for distributed application verification
          in Coq based on a novel abstraction that models systems as a tree of
          committed and uncommitted commands that can be atomically manipulated.
          Proved the correctness of several non-trivial distributed
          applications, and showed that many common protocols (e.g., Paxos
          variants, Chain Replication) refine this model.

\cventry{2018--2021}
        {Deep Spec Web Server}

        {%
          Extended CertiKOS with an unverified socket layer to run a verified
          web server written in C.
          Proved the soundness of the web server's user-level axiomatized system
          call specifications with respect to CertiKOS' kernel-level specifications.

          Verified a C implementation of the WormSpace distributed system in Coq
          using Certified Concurrent Abstraction Layers.
          Extended CertiKOS with unverified networking support using the lwIP
          library in order to run WormSpace.
